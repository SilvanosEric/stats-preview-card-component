## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/)
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

- CSS property mix-blend-mode. It allows for one to add an overlay to an image without losing the original color richness of the overlay.
- When one applies an overlay to an image and uses the opacity property, the overlay appears to be faded.
- mix-blend-mode CSS property offers a better alternative

### Continued development

- CSS [mixed-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode)

- CUBE CSS ([Composition](https://cube.fyi/composition.html))

### Useful resources

- [How to use mix-blend-mode, and how to avoid problems with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAA89nkEuhw) - This helped me while trying to add an overlay to the image. It allowed me to deal with the faded effect the overlay initially had when using opacity css property. It acts as a good alternative to the opacity property.

- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - In this amazing article MDN goes over how to set up responsive images for your website, based on your requirements.
